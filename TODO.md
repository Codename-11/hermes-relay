# Hermes-Relay — TODO

Open items that don't fit a formal Phase plan but shouldn't be lost. Items move from here into a Plan in `docs/spec.md` or an Obsidian Phase plan once they're ready to schedule.

## Research / open questions

### Proper Hermes plugin / skill / tool distribution

**Status:** open question, no plan yet.

We currently distribute Hermes-Relay via a one-shot `install.sh` that clones the repo, `pip install -e`s the package into the user's hermes-agent venv, and registers `skills/` via the `external_dirs` config knob. This works but it's a custom protocol — every project that wants to ship a Hermes plugin reinvents it.

Things to look into:

- **Does upstream hermes-agent have or plan a canonical plugin registry / package format?** If yes, we should migrate to it. If no, we may want to propose one upstream so third-party plugins (ours and others) get a standard install path.
- **Skill distribution as separate from plugin distribution** — right now skills ride along with the plugin install via `external_dirs`. Should skills be installable independently (e.g. `hermes skill install <git-url>`)? Would that fragment maintenance or improve reuse?
- **Tool registration discoverability** — `android_*` tools register at gateway import time. There's no canonical "list installed plugin tools" API. Would adding one to upstream make sense, or is `gateway tool list` already enough?
- **Versioning + compatibility ranges** — `pip install -e` doesn't enforce version pins between hermes-agent and our plugin. A breaking change in upstream's plugin loader could silently break us. Do we need a `hermes_compat: ">=0.8.0,<1.0.0"` field somewhere?
- **`hermes-relay-self-setup` SKILL.md as a precedent** — we just shipped a self-installing skill that an LLM can fetch from a raw GitHub URL and execute. Does this pattern generalize? Could it become a recommended way for any third-party Hermes project to ship setup automation?
- **Bootstrap injection** — `hermes_relay_bootstrap/` monkey-patches `aiohttp.web.Application` to inject endpoints into vanilla upstream. This is intentional but feels like a hack. Upstream PR #8556 will eventually let us delete it. Track that PR's status periodically.

When the answer becomes clearer, this section becomes either an ADR in `docs/decisions.md` or a Plan under `Plans/`.

## Smaller deferred items

- **MediaProjection consent flow** — wired in MainActivity (2026-04-12), needs end-to-end test on a real device
- **WorkManager upgrade for auto-disable timer** — currently a coroutine `Job + delay()` in `AutoDisableWorker.kt`; documented at top of file. Upgrade when androidx.work joins the classpath
- **Wave 3 voice-bridge multi-turn confirmation** — currently a 5s TTS countdown with cancel; conversational confirmation is the follow-up
- **LLM client wiring for `android_navigate`** — `_default_vision_model` is stubbed; production swap to a real Anthropic/OpenAI vision client
- **Real screenshots of each flavor's a11y permission dialog** — for `user-docs/guide/release-tracks.md`
- **`llms.txt` standard** — explicitly skipped in favor of the `hermes-relay-self-setup` SKILL.md path; revisit if the standard gains traction in the agent ecosystem
