# Hermes Companion — Dev Log

## 2026-04-05 — Project Scaffolding

**Done:**
- Wrote spec (docs/spec.md) and decisions (docs/decisions.md)
- Created CLAUDE.md handoff for agent development
- Created DEVLOG.md

## 2026-04-05 — MVP Phase 0 + Phase 1 Implementation

**Done:**
- Created Android app — full Jetpack Compose project (30+ files, 2500+ lines)
  - Bottom nav scaffold with 4 tabs (Chat, Terminal, Bridge, Settings)
  - WSS connection manager (OkHttp, auto-reconnect with exponential backoff)
  - Channel multiplexer (typed envelope protocol)
  - Auth flow (6-char pairing code → session token in EncryptedSharedPreferences)
  - Chat UI: message bubbles, streaming text, tool progress cards, profile selector
  - Settings UI: server URL, connection status, theme selector
  - Material 3 + Material You dynamic theming
  - @Preview composables for MessageBubble and ToolProgressCard
  - Terminal and Bridge tabs stubbed for Phase 2/3
- Created companion relay — Python aiohttp WSS server (10 files, 1500+ lines)
  - WSS server on port 8767 with health check
  - Auth: pairing codes (10min expiry), session tokens (30-day expiry), rate limiting
  - Chat channel: proxies to Hermes WebAPI SSE, re-emits as WS envelopes
  - Terminal/bridge channel stubs
  - Runnable via `python -m companion_relay`
- Created CI/CD — GitHub Actions
  - CI: lint → build (debug APK) → test, relay syntax check
  - Release: tag-triggered, version validation, signed APK → GitHub Release

## 2026-04-05 — Repo Restructure + Build Fixes

**Done:**
- Promoted Android project to repo root (Android Studio opens root directly)
- Removed `hermes-android-bridge/` (upstream absorbed into Compose rewrite)
- Renamed `hermes-android-plugin/` → `plugin/`
- Moved root `tools/`, `skills/`, `tests/` into `plugin/`
- Resolved build issues: gradle.properties, launcher icons, SDK path, compileSdk 36
- Pinned AGP 8.13.2 + Gradle 8.13 + JVM toolchain 17
- Added dev scripts (`scripts/dev.sh` + `scripts/dev.bat`)
- Updated all docs (README, CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, DEVLOG.md, spec directory structure)
- Build verified: debug APK builds successfully

**Current state:**
- Phase 0 + Phase 1 complete
- Android Studio opens and syncs from repo root
- Debug APK builds and deploys to emulator/device
- Dev scripts ready for build/install/run/test/relay workflows

**Next:**
- Test on emulator and physical device (S25 Ultra, wireless debugging)
- Connect to running Hermes WebAPI and test chat end-to-end
- Phase 2: Terminal channel (xterm.js in WebView, tmux integration)
- Phase 3: Bridge channel migration
