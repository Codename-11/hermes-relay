# Potential Upstream Contributions to hermes-agent

Improvements that would benefit hermes-android (and other frontends) if added to [NousResearch/hermes-agent](https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent).

## 1. `GET /api/commands` — Expose Gateway Slash Commands

**Current state:** Built-in slash commands (29 gateway-compatible commands like `/new`, `/retry`, `/model`, `/yolo`, etc.) are defined in `hermes_cli/commands.py` as `COMMAND_REGISTRY` / `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS`. There is no HTTP API to fetch them — the app must hardcode the list.

**Proposed:** Add a `GET /api/commands` endpoint to `gateway/platforms/api_server.py` that returns `GATEWAY_KNOWN_COMMANDS` with their names, descriptions, aliases, categories, and argument specs.

**Response format:**
```json
{
  "commands": [
    {
      "name": "/new",
      "aliases": ["/reset"],
      "description": "Start a new session",
      "category": "session",
      "args": null
    },
    {
      "name": "/model",
      "aliases": [],
      "description": "Switch model for this session",
      "category": "configuration",
      "args": "[model] [--global]"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Impact:** All frontends (hermes-android, hermes-workspace, ClawPort) could dynamically show available commands without hardcoding. New commands added upstream would appear automatically.

**Workaround (current):** 29 gateway commands hardcoded in `ChatScreen.kt`, manually synced with `hermes_cli/commands.py`. Personality commands generated from `GET /api/config`. Skills from `GET /api/skills`.

## 2. Personality Switching via Dedicated API Parameter

**Current state:** The chat streaming endpoint (`POST /api/sessions/{id}/chat/stream`) accepts `system_message` for ephemeral system prompts. To switch personalities, the app sends the personality's system prompt text as `system_message`. This works but is indirect — the app must know the full prompt text.

**Proposed:** Add a `personality` parameter to the chat request body that the server resolves against `config.agent.personalities`. The server would look up the system prompt and apply it, without the client needing to send the full prompt text.

```json
{
  "message": "Hello",
  "personality": "creative"
}
```

**Impact:** Cleaner API contract, client doesn't need to fetch and send system prompt text, server-side validation of personality names.

**Workaround (current):** App fetches `config.agent.personalities` map, sends the system prompt as `system_message`.

## 3. Terminal HTTP API (for non-relay setups)

**Current state:** hermes-agent's `terminal_tool.py` supports 6 backends (local, Docker, SSH, Modal, Daytona, Singularity) but is only callable internally by the agent during conversations. There is no HTTP API for interactive terminal sessions.

**Proposed:** Add terminal session endpoints to the gateway, similar to what hermes-workspace implements (HTTP/SSE for output, POST for input/resize/close).

**Impact:** Would enable mobile terminal access without requiring the separate relay server. Any hermes-agent install would support remote terminal.

**Workaround (current):** Our relay server (`relay_server/`) provides terminal via WSS as a separate service. This works but requires deploying an additional component.

## Notes

- These are suggestions, not requirements. The app works without any of them.
- Priority: #1 (`/api/commands`) is the most impactful for code maintainability.
- All workarounds are documented in `docs/decisions.md`.
